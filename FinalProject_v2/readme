Collaboratively created a mock movie retail front and backend using MVC architecture.

Stores login details, allows the user to search for any movie that is available, and allows the user to purchase their desired
movie sending a receipt.

Involves communication between a MariaDB database hosted by XAMPP with a frontend using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, all using a controller written in PHP to facilitate.
